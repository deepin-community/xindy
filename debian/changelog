xindy (2.4-1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * debian/control:
    - Add texlive-lang-greek build dependency. Seems no longer
      pulled automatically by TeXLive (Closes: #713496).
    - Bump Standards Version. No changes needed.

xindy (2.4-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Make xindy work around clisp 2.49 not bumping LISPOBJ(version..)
    thus giving wrong clisp-fasl-loader version (Closes: #617378).
    This change is a dirty hack for xindy that should be reverted
    when built against newer clisp upstream release.

 -- Agustin Martin Domingo <agmartin@debian.org>  Fri, 02 Sep 2011 17:19:04 +0200

xindy (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #555947)

  * Removed patches from the Debian package:
    + fix-manpages: the manpage in question was removed

    + rebuild-manpages: upstream updated the manpages, hence the
      problem with hyphen vs. dash is gone.

  * Set dependency on clisp-fasl-loader to ensure the correct clisp
    version is installed, because clisp's memory dumps depend on the
    version used for the dump. (closes: #580762)

  * Bumped Standards-Version; no changes needed.

  * Added debian/source/format to the source package. We still use
    format version 1.0, because we use dpatch with the script patch
    config.guess+sub.

  * Provided watch file.

  * Dropped useless dependency on texlive-xetex. It was added erroneously.

xindy (2.4~pre1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a workaround for the broken check around
    --disable-(make-rules|docs) in configure. (closes: #548451)

xindy (2.4~pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; downloaded from
    http://www.xindy.org/xindy-2.4-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz on 2009-09-20.

  * Remove dpatches:
    + latex-call and fix-stdout are applied upstream

    + fix-clisp-problems is obsolate due to new upstream source structure

  * New version requires build dependency on texlive-xetex.

  * Remove libffcall1-dev for build dependencies and replace clisp-dev by
    clisp, because the new version doesn't use an external clisp module,
    anymore.

  * Mark the xindy package buildable on any architecture, because we
    aren't limited to the architectures with external linking support
    anymore. We can build everywhere where CLISP is.

  * Added DM-Upload-Allowed to allow direct uploads by me.

  * Added fix-alphabets-doc-geometry.dpatch to correct the geometry of
    the document /u/s/d/x/alphabets-doc.pdf.
    Thanks to Simon Spiegel <simon@simifilm.ch> for reporting this issue.

  * Added the file README.source to describe how to use dpatch (or better
    said link to the defaul description in /usr/share/doc/dpatch). This
    satisfies the requirement of the Debian policy 3.8.0.

  * Bump policy version to 3.8.3

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining.

xindy (2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * I found a better way to work around for the broken ordrulei.c
    generated by clisp. Added the dpatch fix-clisp-problems.dpatch for it
    and extended it to fix the new problems. (closes: #467585)

  * Added libffcall1-dev to the Build-Depends field, because it's
    necessary on linking with clisp-link, but clisp-dev doesn't have it
    as dependency. Otherwise the build of Xindy would fail.

  * Forgot to move the files in /u/l/xindy/modules/styles to
    /u/s/xindy/styles. Extended fix-FHS.dpatch.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining.

xindy (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Removed external-clisp.dpatch, fix-cleanup.dpatch, fix-serbian.dpatch
    and fix-errors.dpatch. All are applied to the upstream source.

  * Rebuilt the manual pages tex2xindy.1, texindy.1 and xindy.1 at
    buildtime to fix the hyphen vs. minus sign problems. Removed the
    patch fix-manpage.dpatch.

  * Added a new patch fix-manpages.dpatch to correct the section of
    xindy.v2.1; 1 instead of 1L.

  * Adapted fix-FHS.dpatch to the new sources.

  * Made the path to clisp more generic. (closes: #458883)

  * Added workaround for broken clisp.
    + Clisp generates a broken rte/ordrules/ordrulei.c which includes
      undefined data types. Fixed by removing this lines from the
      generated file.

    + clisp-link calls the linker with -ldb, but a libdb.so doesn't
      exist. Clisp itself is linked against libdb-4.6. Due to this I
      replace the -ldb by -ldb-4.6 in the file makevars.

    + clisp-link links the binary with libSM and libICE while
      dpkg-shlibdeps complains no symbols are used from these libraries.
      Removed them from the linker call.

  * Used the (new) real header instead of the Homepage pseudo header.

  * Added Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git header.

  * Bumped Standards-Version; no changes needed.

  * Updated get-orig-source target in rules.

  * Added a simple function test simple_index in debian/tests.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining.

  * Acknowledge NMU. (closes: #424976)

  * Excluded arm, hppa, ia64, m68k, mipsel and s390 from the list of
    supported architectures. For every other architecture the clisp
    maintainer had enabled FFI support, at least in version 1:2.41-1.

  * make the build target in debian/rules emtpy, binary-arch and
    binary-indep does everything (Closes: #424976)

 -- Norbert Preining <preining@debian.org>  Sat, 19 May 2007 11:15:12 +0200

xindy (2.2~beta2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the build rules (in debian/rules) to use different configure
    calls for the different targets build-indep and build-arch. For
    build-arch, configure is instructed to build no documentation and
    make-rules, because latex is not available. (closes: #424976)

  * Removed tetex-extra as a possible build dependency, because it's
    removed from Debian.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining.

xindy (2.2~beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release; closes: #362584

    architecture-independent.
